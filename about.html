        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>I'm Josh Boothman - a freelance web developer based in Mole Creek, Tasmania. </p>
        <p>I build websites for small businesses and not-for-profits </p>
        <p>with a focus on clear communication, authentic design, and local connection.</p>

          <h2>Small Business Know-How</h2>
          <img src="images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="Josh Boothman" class="profile-pic">
          <p>My wife and I have been small business owners in the area of technology for most of our lives,
          recently running a hospitality business here in Mole Creek for six years.
          In that time, we built strong relationships with locals and learned
          firsthand the challenges small businesses face - especially when it comes to getting online.</p>
          <p>Meander Valley Web Design was born from that experience.
          It's our way of helping other community-focused businesses show up online with confidence 
          with websites that are easy to use, reflect who they are, and grow with them over time.</p>

        <h2>What I Value</h2>

          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> You'll always know what you're getting, what it costs, and how it works.</li>
          <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> I work with you like a partner, not just a provider.</li>
          <li><strong>Careful Craft:</strong> Every detail matters - from colours to copy.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Insight:</strong> I live and work in Meander Valley. I know the pace, the vibe, and what makes our community tick.</li>
